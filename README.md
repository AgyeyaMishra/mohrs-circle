# Mohr's Circle

This is a really small personal project done for **Department of Civil Engineering, Delhi Technological University (formerly, Delhi College of Engineering)** for a course in **Mechanics of Solid (Course Code - CE202)**.

It is a simple program using ```Python```, ```Numpy``` and ```Matplotlib```which helps a user to plot Mohr's Cirle when given the two-dimensional state of stress.
